# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Docker on client directory

docker build -f Dockerfile -t client .

docker run -it -p 4001:3000 client

Here, we are exposing port 3000 (the port that runs the React application) to port 4001 outside the container—run the above command. If you open http://localhost:4001 on a browser now, you will see that the React app is working inside Docker.

### Docker on api directory

docker build -f Dockerfile -t api .

docker run -it -p 4002:3001 api

Here, we are exposing port 3001 (the port that is running the Node.js server application) to port 4002 outside the container—run the above command.
If you now open http://localhost:4002/ on a browser, you can see that the Node.js home route is okay and the app is working inside Docker.

### Docker on root directory

docker-compose build

docker-compose up

to have Client, API, and Database, all running in separated containers with only one command.
